# 🚫 DistraX – Blur Distracting Websites

**DistraX** is a minimal, no-nonsense Chrome extension that helps you stay focused by *blurring* distracting websites instead of outright blocking them. Just enough friction to stop you from falling into the rabbit hole — while still keeping things usable when needed.

## 🧠 Why I Built It

I tend to get easily distracted online — a quick scroll turns into 30 minutes lost. But I realized that sometimes, all I need is a small *nudge* to stay on track. **DistraX** became that gentle push for me. 

So I built this extension to help others like me: people who don’t want rigid site blockers, but just a simple way to stay mindful and focused. Nothing bloated — just a quick, effective tool.
