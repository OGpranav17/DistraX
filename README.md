## 🧠 Why I Built It

I tend to get easily distracted online — a quick scroll turns into 30 minutes lost. But I realized that sometimes, all I need is a small *nudge* to stay on track. **DistraX** became that gentle push for me. 

So I built this extension to help others like me: people who don’t want rigid site blockers, but just a simple way to stay mindful and focused. Nothing bloated — just a quick, effective tool.

If you're competetive like me and yearn to gain XP and acheivements (Gamers Assemble!) DistraX gives you this satisfaction by providing XP and providing levelups overtime based on how many productive choices you took !
